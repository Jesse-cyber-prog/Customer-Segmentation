# Customer-Segmentation
This project involves the analysis of a transactional dataset from a UK-based retailer, covering transactions from 2010 to 2011. The objective is to enhance marketing strategies and increase sales. This is achieved by transforming the data into a customer-centric format and applying K-means clustering for customer segmentation. The resulting segmentation facilitates the understanding of distinct customer profiles and preferences.
